		" 200 South Bronx families will have the support of a Doula free of cost through the City Wide Doula initiative. Doulas hired by the city are now providing healthcare to pregnant women in the South Bronx  as part of an effort to address high rates of maternal and infant mortality that have plagued the community for years. "
		<br>
		<br>
		" Chanel Porchia and her community organization, Ancient Song Doula Services, is helping to train and organize the doulas that have been hired by the city to help women of color in the South Bronx give birth safely. Systematic racism has been identified as a public health issue. The City Wide Doula Initiative aims to address health disparities for women of color who are 9X more likely to die in childbirth. The World Health organization has recommended that Doulas attend births globally as direct doula support has improved outcomes for parent and child. Doulas can offer families help with preparing for a baby, stress relief techniques, knowledge of birth processes, as well as emotional and physical support." 
		<br>

		" This program aims to directly address racial birth disparities in Maternal mortality. Mayor Adams underscored the importance of doulas and Midwives in improving birth outcomes for women of color in New York and Racism as a Public health issue. This marks an intentional shift where birth workers of color are encouraged to accompany their clients into hospitals and acknowledgement of systemic racism as a public health issue. "

	<h3>"Increased need for Community Based Health Care</h3>
<p> United Nations commission for Human Rights reccomended the United States ensure access to affordable health care to reduce maternal mortality and ensure all people have access to reproductive health care services and information including safe and legal abortion.
